About section for the owner of the site, providing information on their background
and what lead them into the coding world. It gives a bit of impact with the story
and sets up for general caring about what they do personally and professionaly.

After this we have the same full width and half width sections to split up the
text into a left and right column, then align those columns with the starting
h2 header.

We go into the work section after here, setting up the same full width, but
using a third width instead afterwards since we are added 3 individual sections
here, instead of two.

              <p>
                Currently I reside in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. Enjoying the
                warmer weather and the sun here. While still developing and
                expanding my horizon with code and website building in general.
                I am looking to move again soon, aiming for oregon this time,
                hoping to be able to expand my horizon more there. While also
                being able to find more work.

                  Personally about me, I am just somebody who loves to explore,
                  discover new things, and see the world around me. I'm currently
                  obtaining my certification in open water diving, with plans to
                  expand out towards advance open water, enriched oxygen, and
                  rebreather certified diving. Between that though, I am looking
                  for a new job.

                My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by
                hand to make sure that the content is easy to read,
                easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.

              <p>
                I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on.
                I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it
                a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.
